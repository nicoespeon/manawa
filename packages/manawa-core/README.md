# Manawa Core

Core of the Manawa packages. It contains the business logic, the domain, of the productivity techniques used (e.g. the Pomodoro Technique®).

Other packages deliver this logic through different channels, acting as adapters, implementing domain concepts into a choosen infrastructure (CLI, web, native app…).
