# üê† Pomodory

## Why "Pomodory"?

Remember [Dory][dory]? Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She has trouble to focus. It surely makes her life hard!

Now, I believe the Pomodoro technique could help Dory focus. Pomodoro makes Dory happy.

**Pomodory helps you stay focus, be productive, be happy.**
