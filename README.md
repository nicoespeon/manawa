# 🎧 Manawa

_Manawa_ is the Hawaïan word for "Time".

In the [Huna philosophy][huna-philosophy-manawa], _Manawa_ is the power of Now, the present moment.

**Manawa** wants to help you stay focus on the thing that matters. Work, when it's time to work. Rest, when it's time to take a break. Yesterday is memory from the past, tomorrow is a mere possibility. Focus on the present. Do your best.

What is the smallest step you can do now, within the next minutes, to bring yourself closer to your vision?

**Manawa helps you stay focus, get things done, feel happy.**
